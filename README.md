# demo-track
Sample experimental subject tracking application written in Python

Notes:

- AWS EB will use Python3

- For Flask under Python 3, we need to make sure we're using the latest
  versions of itsdangerous, Jinja2 and Werkzeug

- We need a requirements.txt file

- The main file should be application.py

- Our WSGI application should be named application - in our case we
  alias our object named `app`
